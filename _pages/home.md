### Welcome!

Welcome to my personal academic webpage! I am deeply passionate about artificial intelligence and its vast applications. Currently, I am actively applying for Ph.D. programs.

### About Me

I am **Wenxiao Xiong**, an undergraduate student at the **School of Computer Science**, **Sun Yat-sen University**. My primary research interests lie in **artificial intelligence**, **machine learning**, especially large models, and their applications in various domains such as medical imaging and data analysis.

I have a strong enthusiasm for research and have been involved in multiple projects to broaden my experience:

- **At Sun Yat-sen University**, I work under the supervision of **Prof. [Xiangyu Meng](https://seit.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/MengXiangyu)**, where I have been engaging in AI-related research projects.
- **At The Pennsylvania State University (PSU)**, I am an intern in **Prof. [Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/)'s** laboratory, contributing to projects on trustworthy multi-modal benchmarks for medical large vision language models.
- **At The University of Virginia (UVa)**, I intern in **Prof. [Sheng Li](https://sheng-li.org/)'s** lab, working on leveraging large language models for SVG flowchart generation.

Feel free to explore my [research projects](/research/) and [publications](/publications/).
